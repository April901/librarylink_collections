  "description": "During Black History Month, the blog The Brown Bookshelf highlights an African-American Childrenâ€™s book or author each day as part of their series, 28 Days Later. This is part of their effort to bring attention to quality books by African-Americans for children that have gone overlooked or flown under the radar. Here are some of the picture books they featured in 2018. You can head to their blog to see books for Middle Grade and Young Adult, as well as what books will be posted for 2019.",
